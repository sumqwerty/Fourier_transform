# Fourier_transform
Applying Fourier transform on hand drawn continuous curves and traced images, and displaying it as epicycles.

This Application allows you to draw free hand continuous loops or trace images to form an continuous outline of the image. The path then is passed
to the DFT(Discrete Fourier transform) fuction, which then is converted to set of epicycles, and these epicycles draw the loop. This can be seen below:
